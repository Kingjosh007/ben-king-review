# Ben-King Review

> In this project, I had to perform a code review of a past project. This simple project was built 5 months ago through pair-programming. Back then, I wasn't yet aware of all the good practices like documenting repos professionally, using tools like Linter, Webhint, choosing semantic tags in HTML, writing good commit messages etc. Now that I know more about those best practices, I was asked to play the role of a Code Reviewer on this old project. 

> I was supposed to open a new Pull Request (PR), check this previous code and write a good code review following the recommended steps. 

In this project, [@BenMukebo](https://github.com/BenMukebo) and I were paired in the Microverse admission process, and together we had to build a page that would be functionally similar to [this example from CodePen](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL).
